The first being scanning\neach directory in the files path for a config file and stopping there.\n\nWhere as the second would continue scanning until it reaches the topmost directory\nthen merging the them together. The settings in the config file closest to the file\ntakes precedence.\n\n#### Why no per-project support\n\nThe per-directory feature can be used as per-project simply by placing the config\nfile in the projects root directory.\n",
