After making a change to the settings they can be updated by searching for **Reload Project Settings** under the Command Palette.\n\n### List `icon:`\nThis changes the icon displayed next to the project title in the list view. The icon is class-based, so you can either use the classes already provided by Atom like `icon-squirrel` or make your own class (target `:before`). The GitHub [octicon](https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0) font is available to use, and most, if not all classes, just replace `octicon-` with `icon-`.\n\n### Example\n```CoffeeScript\n'Project Manager':\n  'title': 'Project Manager'\n  'icon': 'icon-squirrel'\n  'paths': [\n    '/path/to/project-manager'\n  ]\n  'settings':\n    'setSoftTabs': true  # Enable or disable soft tabs for this editor\n    'setSoftWrap': true  # Enable or disable soft wrap for this editor.\n    'setTabLength': 2    # Set the on-screen length of tab characters.\n```\n\n### Atom Settings\n**Show Path:** Shows the path in the list view\n\n**Close Current:** Closes the current window before opening the new project\n\n**Environment Specific Projects:** Use `projects.hostname.cson` instead of `projects.cson`\n\n**Sort By Title:** Sorts the projects list by title in ascending order\n\n## Todo\n- Add multiple directories to a project (Can not currently be done in Atom)",
