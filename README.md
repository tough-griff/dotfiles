My personal configuration and dotfiles.

## installation
--- WIP ---
First, run the following bootstrap script:

```
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tough-griff/dotfiles/master/bootstrapper.sh`"
```

Then, once git and zsh are installed, clone the repository with
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/tough-griff/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.dotfiles"`
and run the install script `install.sh`
